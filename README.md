# HSH Code assignment

## About

This solution is just a simulated solution for developing a application according to an assignment and has thus no real usage other than an example.

**NOTE** The document with the actual assignment is not provided within this solution/repository.

## Design

The following design decision were made:

* OS: `Windows 64-bit` application,
* Language / framework: `C#` with `.NET 8` SDK
* Assembly type: `Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)` as a user interface application
* Unit test frameowrk: `xUnit`
* Strategy: Using `Model-View-ViewModel` design pattern and an attempt to follow the `Test Drive Development (TDD)` discipline for custom back-end types (although not as strict as one would have thought).

## Coding style

This solution follows the following [coding style](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md).

Additionally the format of the `git commit messages` should be simple but descriptive in summarising what was changed and why - but this is rather a recommendation than an assertive rule.
